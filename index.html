      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>I'm James. I'm a husband of a beautiful wife, father of two magnificent young men and five
        beautiful girls, grandfather of two energetic, happy boys and soon to be wrapped around a new
        granddaughters finger. I am a pharmacist by trade and I've just started web development, mainly to
        learn what my sons do for a living and also to gain some skills.</p>
        <p>
          And yes.....         I have a beard.

        <h3>Drug Dealer Extrordinaire</h3>
        <p>When I met my wife in college, I asked her what career path she was following in school.
          Her response was "Pharmacy." I remarked, "I can't imagine a more boring profession." Then...I found out how much they made. Here I am
          nearly 30 years later pushin pills with the best of them. </p>

        <h3>Jack of all Trades - Master of None</h3>
        <p>I like trying something new. Thanks to a great man in my father-in-law, I have learned masonry,
          framing, drywall, painting, plumbing, tilework, and simple electrician skills. I have tinkered in auto-mechanics,
          teaching (the gospel in Sunday School), hiking, biking, kayaking, RVing, drawing, and now coding. It's been fun
          to try new things, and the second time I do them, they dont turn out half bad. </p>
